# Yolo-Object-Detection-in-Drone
Implementation of Yolo Object Detection 🔍 in Robomaster TT Drone 🚁 with display of detected object image in 8X8 LED matrix 🤖

# DJI Robomaster TT Drone Object Detection 🤖📷

## Overview:
In this project, I harnessed the power of the OpenCV library to seamlessly capture video frames from the DJI Robomaster TT drone. The primary objective was to implement the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm on these video frames and display the detection results in an 8x8 matrix LED display.

## Key Components:
1. **OpenCV Video Frame Acquisition 🎥:**
   Utilizing the OpenCV library, I efficiently read video frames from the DJI Robomaster TT drone. This involved managing the height, width, and channels of each frame for subsequent processing.

2. **YOLO Object Detection Algorithm 🚀:**
   The heart of the project lies in the implementation of the YOLO object detection algorithm on the received video frames. The algorithm processes each frame, identifies objects within it, and provides bounding box coordinates along with confidence scores.

3. **Display on 8x8 Matrix LED 💡:**
   To make the results tangible and accessible, I designed a mechanism to display the object detection outcomes on an 8x8 matrix LED display. The display showcases rectangles around detected objects and labels them with their respective class names.
